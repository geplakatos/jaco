Simple remote controller for windows based on java.

Start with release/run.bat. It will open an elevated privilaged level java application which 
can controll the mouse and the keyboard at basic level.

After the server started you can open the local machine(the server log the actual ip to the terminal) webserver on your
smart device's browser and can controll the mouse and the keyboard remotely.
